## About me  

I am a software analyst / programmer, whose interest in computers began as a child when my Uncle bought a BBC Micro Computer and I wrote my first program.
After a long career break, to look after my Mother who had Parkinson's, I am enthusiastic about returning to my IT career as a full stack developer.

I love learning new Technology and am currently brushing up my skills using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Aside from my passion for programming, I am a keen archer 🏹🎯, love practicing yoga🧘🏽‍♀️ and playing pool 🎱 
I also enjoy 🎮video and board games, 🧩jigsaws and puzzles like sudoku and logic problems.

📖 My favourite authors are Douglas Adams and Carl Hiassen.

🌍🧳 I have been fortunate enough to travel throughout my life, and one of my passports had a stamp from every continent (except Antarctica...not been there yet, and there's no official stamp).
